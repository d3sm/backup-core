# backup-core
is my collection of useful config files for Linux (mainly Ubuntu and Arch).
At the moment there are only few *install.sh* and *git* files, though I will update and refactor this repository from time to time.

You may find these files handy as well, for example after clean installing your OS or in need of some rarely used config.

## Usage
1. Firstly, of course, you'll have to clone the repo via ssh   
`git clone git@github.com:d3sm/backup-core.git`
 
    or https  
   `https://github.com/d3sm/backup-core.git`

2. Then, since every file here is either a *.config* or an executable script, or whatever, they won't have a unified installation guide (unless eventually I'll decide to make one or two scripts of them to automate the whole process even further).  
That's why all of these files have been sorted to dedicated folders, each of those provided with their own **README.md** in order to shred some light on the relevant topic

## Pay attention
Please, make sure that you made necessary changes to downloaded files (such as  your own email/name, directory, etc) and understand their purpose before applying anything!
